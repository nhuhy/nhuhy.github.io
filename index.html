    My name is Nicole and here's a few facts about myself:

      <li>I'm currently a fourth year undergraduate student at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN.</li>
      <li>My ethnicity is Korean and I'm fluent in Korean!
      </li>
      <li>One of my favorite places on earth is Madrid, Spain, and I had the pleasure of spending five months there recently.</li>
      <li>I love spending time with friends and family and I'm a big foodie.</li>
      <li>I believe one of the greatest pleasures in life is spending time at a cafe whether by yourself or with others.</li>
      <li>I love music, and have spent almost my entire life performing in some way.</li>
      <li>My greatest, and honestly most useless, talent is being able to recite all 1008 pokemon currently in existence.</li>

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Music <br>
          I play clarinet in my school's orchestra. I've been playing clarinet for roughly 10 years.
          <br>
          I also love to sing, and I have always been in my youth choir at my church for many years. 
          I also had a private gig where I had to sing and play the organ at the same time, despite 
          not knowing how to play the organ.
          <br>
          I also love dancing, despite not having any training or interest in dance until I was older.
          I do love dancing with friends, specifically choreographed Kpop dances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Games<br>
          Specifically Pokemon, I love playing games to pass time and relax. Fun fact, I can name all the pokemon in the world!
        </li>
        <li>
          Crochet<br>
          A new hobby I picked up, I started crocheting recently and fell in love with it!
