    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Music <br>
          I play clarinet in my school's orchestra. I've been playing clarinet for roughly 10 years.
          <br>
          I also love to sing, and I have always been in my youth choir at my church for many years. 
          I also had a private gig where I had to sing and play the organ at the same time, despite 
          not knowing how to play the organ.
          <br>
          I also love dancing, despite not having any training or interest in dance until I was older.
          I do love dancing with friends, specifically choreographed Kpop dances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Games<br>
          Specifically Pokemon, I love playing games to pass time and relax. Fun fact, I can name all the pokemon in the world!
        </li>
        <li>
          Crochet<br>
          A new hobby I picked up, I started crocheting recently and fell in love with it!
