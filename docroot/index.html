<body><p>Welcome to my page!</p><br><p>This is my space to practice using website development tools including html, 
css, javascript elements.&nbsp;I wanted to practice using react, but that requires learning a different framework, 
and I think I will stick with learning JS for now. Here&#39;s just me practicing.&nbsp;
I still need to figure out how to incorporate a style sheet, look forward to the next commit</p>
